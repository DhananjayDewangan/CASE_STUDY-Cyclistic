# SQL Analysis
# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Project

Welcome to the Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis project repository! In this project, I took a deep dive into real-world data analysis using SQL to uncover insights into rider behavior and design a marketing strategy for Cyclistic, a visionary bike-share company in Chicago.

## Project Overview

As part of the Cyclistic marketing analyst team, I followed a structured data analysis process including data preparation, SQL querying, and data visualization. My primary goals were to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and to develop data-driven strategies to convert casual riders into loyal annual members.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Processed Cyclistic's historical trip data to ensure data quality and relevance.
- **SQL Analysis:** Utilized SQL queries to analyze rider behavior patterns, ride lengths, and usage trends.
- **Descriptive Insights:** Extracted actionable insights through descriptive analysis and trend identification.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the Cyclistic historical trip data files.
- `sql_queries/`: Includes SQL scripts used for data analysis and querying.
- `visualizations/`: Contains visual representations of key insights.
- `README.md`: This document, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository using: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cyclistic-bike-share-analysis.git`.
2. Navigate to the `sql_queries/` directory to explore the SQL scripts.

## Results and Conclusion

Through meticulous SQL analysis, I identified significant rider behavior trends and patterns. This project not only provided insights into Cyclistic's operations but also enhanced my skills in data analysis, SQL querying, and data visualization.

Feel free to explore the SQL scripts and visualizations to see how I translated data into actionable strategies.
