2. Unzip the files.
3. Create a folder on your desktop or Drive to house the files. Use appropriate file-naming conventions.
4. Create subfolders for the .CSV file and the .XLS or Sheets file so that you have a copy of the original data. Move the downloaded files to the appropriate 
   subfolder.

#### ASK :
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

#### PREPARE:
Open your spreadsheet and create a column called “ride_length.” Calculate the length of each ride by subtracting the column “started_at” from the column “ended_at” (for example, =D2-C2) and format as HH:MM:SS using Format > Cells > Time > 37:30:55.

Create a column called “day_of_week,” and calculate the day of the week that each ride started using the “WEEKDAY” command (for example, =WEEKDAY(C2,1)) in each file. Format as General or as a number with no decimals, noting that 1 = Sunday and 7 = Saturday.

Results: If you have obtained results from your analysis, you can summarize them in this section. You could also mention if you have exported any data specifically for Excel analysis.

Excel File: Create an Excel file (e.g., "analysis.xlsx") that includes any relevant data or results for analysis. This could be graphs, tables, or any other data that you've generated during your project.

Linking to Excel File: In your README, you can provide a direct link to the Excel file you've created. You can use relative links if the Excel file is stored in the repository. Here's an example Markdown link: [Download Excel Analysis](./analysis.xlsx)
